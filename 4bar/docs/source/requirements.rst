Requirements of the project
===========================

1.0. Web page necessities
-------------------------

1. The page should be a responsive HTML page which returns the pixel values.

2. Should comprise of a setup page where the basic parameters (eg: distance between mounting points, vertical distance to origin is set).

3. Should comprise of a calibration page which should have arrow keys for movement and an analog joypad to control the plotter movement.

4. Plotter should run in manual mode(with joystick) and auto mode where the drawing on HTML page will be drawn.

2.0. Circuit necessities
------------------------

1. The encoder output will be read using an Arduino.

2. Data will be sent to the Raspberrypi serially.

3. Raspberrypi will control the motors (using motor driver) based on the feedback given.

4. 	Calibrating the system for accurate distance measurement.

3.0. Mechanism & Hardware necessities
-------------------------------------

1. The Body will be suspended by 2 strings.

2. The pulleys will be angled in such a way as to provide maximum wrap over the encoder pulleys to prevent any slip.

3. Every co-ordinate will be denoted by 2 lengths. Which the motor will adjust to based on the feedback from the encoders.

4.0. Hardware used
