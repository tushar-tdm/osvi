============================================================================

Remote Triggered Vertical Plotter is a project undertaken by a team of students under the expert guidance
of Prof Pruthviraj Umesh and `Center of System Design, NITK Surathkal <http://csd.nitk.ac.in/>`_

This project is inspired by the idea of horizontal plotters for if we can build a horizontal plotter,
then why not a vertical plotter ?
