Drawing on the canvas
=====================

Now that the bot is calibrated & we have also performed a check on the 2 way communication between them,
it's time to finally start with the main purpose of this project i.e. **Making the bot draw something on the canvas**.

After you press ``Start Drawing`` , it should finally lead you too:

.. image:: _static/images/FIFTH_PAGE.png

.. centered:: **Fig 1** : Drawing page. 

Try to draw something on the highlighted area. Once your artwork is ready, press ``Submit`` and the 
bot should start drawing your artwork on the canvas. 

In case your artwork goes wrong, you can press ``Reset`` and start afresh.
