Simulation of the bot
=====================

Now that we have calibrated our bot, we are ready to see if we can simulate it real time to make sure 
that the calibration has been done properly & for a 2 way communication check between the application 
and the bot.

After pressing ``Calibrate`` in the previous page, we should be seeing something like this:

.. centered:: **Fig 1** : Simulation page.

Again, we can move the bot in 8 different directions.
